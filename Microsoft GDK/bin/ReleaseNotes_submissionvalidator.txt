If anti-virus software or indexing software is running on the PC being used to build the package, then is it is possible to end up with non-contiguous blocks in the package which can result in content update issues at a later date. Submission validator now detects these types of issues and reports a failure.


--------------------------------------
Version 6.2.11250.0 (6/6/2014)
--------------------------------------
This release of Submission Validator includes the following changes:
* Add validation for new mx:GpuAvailability feature in AppXManifest.xml
* Provide an offline fallback mode when Submission Validator cannot access version information via HTTP port 80
* Improve validation of Microsoft component DLLs for Shared resource applications 
* Report a WARNING rather than a FAILURE in the case of an unversioned microsoft.xbox.gamechat.dll
* Report a WARNING rather than a FAILURE in the case of a deprecated version of Microsoft XDK/ADK component DLL
* Correct an issue with the handling of some absolute paths in the layout XML file
* Correct an issue where Submission Validator was incorrectly checking for GameOS for DLC packages

* Add validation for new mx:GpuAvailability feature in AppXManifest.xml
If the new mx:GpuAvailabilty element is present in the AppXManifest.xml, it will be validated to only contain an appropriate value. 

* Provide an offline fallback mode when Submission Validator cannot access version information via HTTP port 80
If the version checking information cannot be accessed when Submission Validator is running because there is no access to HTTP port 80, the log will contain this warning
	<warning>Could not validate MS component versions against online approved library list. 
	Using offline fallback version check.</warning>
The fallback version check information will not necessarily be as up to date as the online information, but it is often adequate and allows those with build infrastructure policies blocking internet access to prepare products for submission. 

* Improve validation of Microsoft component DLLs for Shared resource applications 
In previous releases the validation of Microsoft component DLLs for Shared resource applications was less complete that the same checks applied to Exclusive resource applications. This has been corrected. 

* Report a WARNING rather than a FAILURE in the case of an unversioned microsoft.xbox.gamechat.dll
Some partners using early Xbox One development kits were provided special releases of the Microsoft.Xbox.GameChat.dll that were not version stamped. This led to failures being flagged by Submission Validator. This DLL now has special handling that results in a warning if it does not have a version number. Other Microsoft component DLLs without versions will still be failures. (Note that the copies of the GameChat DLL that ship in the XDK and ADK do have correct version stamps.)

* Report a WARNING rather than a FAILURE in the case of a deprecated version of Microsoft XDK/ADK component DLL
If a component is from an ADK or XDK that has been deprecated, it can still continue to be used in updates to titles that originally shipped on that ADK or XDK. Therefore, this message has been corrected to be a warning rather than a failure. 

* Correct an issue with the handling of some absolute paths in the layout XML file
In some instances, the way paths were specified in the layout XML was leading to errors in the Submission Validator which blocked the tool from running. This has been corrected. 
Additionally, in instances where a directory or file referenced in the layout XML file did not exist or was otherwise unable to be read (as with a file system permissions problem) there would be errors that would prevent a successful Submission Validator run. This has been corrected. 

* Correct an issue where Submission Validator was incorrectly checking for GameOS for DLC packages
Submission Validator was incorrectly checking for the GameOS for DLC packages. 

Note: For users of the June 2014 (and later) XDK and ADK, you can now cause Submission Validator to perform its checks without fully packaging the application. This is done by using the "MakePkg Validate" command rather than the "MakePkg Pack" command. MakePkg Validate uses the same parameters as MakePkg Pack.


--------------------------------------
Version 6.2.10932.0 (4/23/2014)
--------------------------------------
This release of Submission Validator includes the following changes:
* Fixed issue with the previous release (6.2.10812.0) not working correctly when used with pre-April 2014 ADK/XDK installations.
* Fixed issue listed as a "Known Issue" in the previous release (6.2.10812.0) where Submission Validator did not produce a complete log in cases where the machine on which is running cannot access the online version information.
Note: When used with April 2014 or later ADK/XDK, Submission Validator no longer required to set the environment variables XDK_CERT_LAYOUT and XDK_CERT_GAMEOS before running Submission Validator. HOWEVER, partners using a pre-April 2014 ADK/XDK will still need to set those environment variables to get complete results from Submission Validator. The release notes for the previous release incorrectly stated the environment variables were no longer required without making the distinction for users of older ADK/XDK releases. 


--------------------------------------
Version 6.2.10812.0 (4/14/2014)
--------------------------------------
This release of Submission Validator includes the following changes:
* No longer required to set the environment variables XDK_CERT_LAYOUT and XDK_CERT_GAMEOS before running Submission Validator
* Submission Validator now uses online information to check its own version, as well as versions of the GameOS and other Microsoft components in the package
* New check for ConnectedStorage quota limit changes
* New check for mixed EXEs/DLLs in the same chunk as other files

* It's no longer necessary to set the environment variables XDK_CERT_LAYOUT and XDK_CERT_GAMEOS before running MakePkg.exe (which in turn calls Submission Validator). These environment variables previously had to be set to point to the chunk layout XML file and the GameOS file, respectively. Submission Validator now takes these values from the MakePkg.exe command line arguments that the user was already supplying. 

* Submission Validator will now access a version information file online when it runs. This information is accessed via HTTP. It uses the information in this file to perform two types of checks: 
   * It will now check to ensure that the version installed is the most current and correct version. If it is not, there will be a failure logged in in the Submission Validator output log, and that failure message will contain a link to download the correct version. 
      <component>Available Version Check</component>
      <failure>A required update to Submission Validator is available. XDK users must download from 
	http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393356. ADK users must download from http://go.microsoft.com
	/fwlink/?LinkId=393357. Download and install the update, then rebuild the package. Contact your 
	Developer Account Manager for assistance.</failure>
   * It will also use this online information to check that the GameOS (for exclusive titles) and any optional components from the XDK are from the same release of the XDK and that they are an approved version for use in released titles. If the version is not on the approved or deprecated list, a failure will be included in the validator log.
	<failure>The GameOS included in this package is not an approved version. Use only 
	supported GameOS versions according to the Approved Libraries page on the Developer 
	Network Portal</failure>
If the version is found to on the deprecated list, a warning will be included in the validator log indicating that this is only valid for content updates for titles originally released on that deprecated version. 
	<warning>The GameOS included in this package is not approved for new title submissions. 
	This version is allowed only for Content Updates where the original release used this 
	version. Use only supported GameOS versions according to the Approved Libraries page on 
	the Developer Network Portal</warning>
If the versions of the components don’t match each other, or if the version is not on the approved or deprecated lists, then a failure will be logged, such as this example: 
	<failure>The GameOS version does not match the version of other Microsoft components 
	included in this package. Use only components from the same XDK release. Refer to the 
	Approved Libraries page on the Developer Network Portal</failure>
KNOWN ISSUE: there is a known issue that may prevent Submission Validator from completing its validation checks if the computer on which it is running cannot access the HTTP location - such as if the PC has no internet access, is blocked by a firewall or has no network connectivity at all. This will be corrected in a future update of Submission Validator. 

* There is a new check related to the mx:ConnectedStorage element in the AppXManifest checks. If this element appears in the manifest and includes a change in the connected storage quota limit, the following warning will appear in the log: 
    mx:ConnectedStorage element specifies a change in connected storage quota limit. This requires a certification exception. 
    Contact your Developer Account Manager

* There is a new check to remind title developers to separate their executable (EXE and DLL) components from their other files (assets, etc.) in their chunk layout. This corresponds to the newly identified best practice to minmimize download sizes for future updates. When this situation is detected, a warning like the following will appear in the Submission Validator log file. 
      <component>Mismatched Chunk Contents Check</component>
      <warning>Chunk 1000 contains a mixture of files with executable data and files without executable data.  
	To optimize for future Content Updates to executables, you are advised to place files with executable 
	content into their own chunks.  If you are packaging an update to an existing title, ignore this warning 
	for any chunks which you are not adding/modifying in this update.</warning>
